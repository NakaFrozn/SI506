The mucus is a defense mechanism, released into the water (or in one unfortunate incident, all over an Oregon highway) when the fish feels threatened. Once it hits seawater, a tiny amount of the ooze expands to 10,000 times its original size in a fraction of a second, forming a tenacious web of goo. A shark trying to take a bite of a hagfish will find itself suddenly unable to breathe, its gills clogged with the slime.",
